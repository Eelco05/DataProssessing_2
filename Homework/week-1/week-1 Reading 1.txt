2. 	Color: 	Color is the main way the information of this graphic is communicated. 
		It is used in a associative way, meaning it uses color to assign 
		different areas a similar value.
	Grain: 	The orientation in this graphic gives makes it possible to make further 
		assosiate areas. However, in this case the use of a limited amount of 
		grain types and its coloring abfuscates more of the meaning than it 
		reveals. This is especially irritating considering the same page contains
		more graphics that have similar values.
		
3. 	Yes, i do. Art in my opinion is meant to convey an idea, meaning and/or feeling 
	of its creator to another. Visiualisation does just that. It creates something 
	visible that the viewer van see and interpret. In this case however it conveys 
	empirical data to inform the viewer of something, instead of (directly) invocing
	a more emotional response.

4.	Where archaeology has been found: 
	It does do this, but in such a way that it abfuscates the exact location and 
	finds.

	Where archaeology can possibly be found: 
	It does this quite well, but the graphic hinders itself by a poor desicion making
	in selecting relevent data and a good color scheme.

	How landscape and archaeology relate to one another: 
	It does, but it requires a certain amount of knowlegde on the part of the viewer.

Vraag.
Ik heb tot nu toe alleen nog maar programmeren 1 afgerond maar ben ondanks dat in groep A
geplaatst. Hierdoor heb ik nog geen evaring met het werken met Javascript en kan ik nog
niet aan de slag met het technische deel. Kan ik mogelijk nog in een groep B geplaatst worden?
